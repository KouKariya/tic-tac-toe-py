# tic-tac-toe-py
Instructional piece of code designed to give an overview of basic python concepts that can be applied to build a simple game of tic tac toe.
This script takes concepts like variables, if statements, loops, function definition and other topics that are normally covered
within a first semester of a Computer Science course and applies that knowledge to create a working text based game
that works of a shell.

#variables
The following folder contains sample scripts that show the user what variables are and how they are used in Python.

#if statements
This folder contains a sample script that explains if statements in Python and how conditional statements can help control the flow of a program.

#loops
This folder contains a sample script that explains the different types of loops that can be written in Python and how they can be used.

#lists
This folder contains a sample script that shows the user how to use lists in Python and the importance of storing multiple variables within a single list.

#functions
This last folder contains a sample script that shows the user how to break up Python code using functions. The user is also walked through the importance of being able to break up one's code.


Some functionality, like checking for blank spaces or terminating a full game, have not been written in this script.
 These features have been purposely left out to encourage students to develop solutions to these problems.
