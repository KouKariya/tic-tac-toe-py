# tic-tac-toe-py
Instructional piece of code designed to give an overview of basic python concepts that can be applied to build a simple game of tic tac toe.
This script takes concepts like variables, if statements, loops, function definition and other topics that are normally covered
within a first semester of a Computer Science course and applies that knowledge to create a working text based game
that works of a shell.

Some functionality, like checking for blank spaces or terminating a full game, have not been written in this script.
 These features have been purposely left out to encourage students to develop solutions to these problems.
